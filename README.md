🏓 Pong Game

A modern, browser-based **Pong Game** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
This project recreates the iconic 1970s arcade game with smooth animations, responsive gameplay, and an elegant minimalist interface.  

It demonstrates **core JavaScript logic**, **DOM manipulation**, and **canvas-based animation** — making it a great portfolio project for web developers.

🧠 How It Works

The Canvas API creates the game field and draws the ball and paddles.

The JavaScript game loop runs continuously with requestAnimationFrame() for smooth animation.

The ball’s position updates based on velocity vectors.

Collision detection ensures the ball bounces off walls and paddles.

When the ball passes a paddle, the opponent scores a point.

The game resets automatically or via restart button.

🎨 UI & Design

Minimalist dark theme with glowing elements.

Center-aligned playfield for all screen sizes.

Smooth score animation and restart transition.

Custom colors:

Background: #0a0a0a
